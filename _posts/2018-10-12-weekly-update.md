Wow this is late! Every time I have tried to keep some kind of journal, I always fall behind or stop using it completely. My bad.
<br>
<br>
A lot has been going on since my last update! I am now writing a paper on my first results. I have found the process to be quite intimidating, but I am working through each section slowly but surely. It is really helping me wrap my head around certain subjects, and proves to be a useful exercise (who knew?).
<br>
<br>
I also learned that my group is headed to Japan in December to attend a Stellar Archaeology conference. I am so excited!! I will be presenting my results there to a wider audience, and I will get to participate in some scientific outreach while I am there.

Speaking of outreach, I have become a STEM mentor for the Atlanta CSO program. I recently gave a presentation about myself to Atlanta students, and they asked some awesome questions. Speaking with students of all ages is something that is so important for scientists to do. I'm looking forward to seeing where this program takes me.
