title: "First Research Update!"
date: 2018-07-20

After getting my website up and running, I am finally ready to start posting research (and sometimes personal) updates! My plan is to post once a week, likely on Fridays, about what I have done during the week and what my plans are for the week ahead. This also will include any papers that I have read during the week. My hope is that this is a good summary for me to see what I have accomplished, and not accomplished, during the week, and for others to stay updated on what I am working on.

As this is my first summer in graduate school, I have been spending a lot of time getting used to the tools that my research group has been using, specifically <a href="https://yt-project.org/"><font color="#0000ff">yt</font></a>. This is an incredibly useful tool for analyzing <a href="https://enzo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><font color="#0000ff">Enzo</font></a> outputs, and I'm very excited to learn more about it as I continue my research.

Lately, I have been working on studying the halo properties that host new Pop3 stars. To do this, I have had to learn how to parallelize my yt routines, which took some work. If I hadn't parallelized, I would probably still be waiting for my first script to finish running... I have been able to find the median halomass that new Pop3 stars live in from a redshift of 27 to 9. Currently, I am working on finding the average lyman werner background in these host halos across the above redshift range, to get an idea of how this background might change through time, and how this might affect Pop3 star formation.

While I have been waiting for my scripts to run, I have been working on this website! I think it turned out alright. I still have a few things to update (like the upside down picture on my outreach page -- if anyone has any idea about how to fix this, please comment below), but it is fairly complete as of now.
