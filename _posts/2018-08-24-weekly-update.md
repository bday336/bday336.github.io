After some time off visiting family, I am back in the office and taking classes! This semester I will be taking Nuclei, Particles and Fields with a few of my officemates. I'm looking forward to learning more about particles and the weird things that go on when they interact with each other and their velocities approach the speed of light. It feels a little strange to be back in classes after all the classes I took last year. It's very refreshing to be taking just one!

On the research side, I have been doing some major code cleanup and generating new plots. I have generated close up projections of the PopIII stars I am focused on and have been working on learning the trajectory of some outlier PopIII stars. I am also finding that most of the halos, once I add in the constant Lyman-Werner background on top of the background from local sources, fall well below the Machacek+ minimum halo mass threshold.

Currently, I am having a problem with making the x-axis on my 2d-histogram, using plt.hist2d, log scale. I am finding that my plot does not change when I go from a linear scale, to a log scale. I noticed that this was a problem back in 2015, but I was hoping this would be fixed by now. As a solution, I am using pcolormesh to plot the 2-d histogram. But it would be nice ot know how plt.hist2d works with log scale!

I have also spent some time this week following the first year graduate students through a lab simulation. During this simulation, organized by the great Emily Alicea-Munoz, the grad students get to experience what TA'ing a lab will feel like. We plant sabotage students who are supposed to cause problems for the TA, because real life TA'ing will definitely have some trouble students! It's a lot of fun, and I know when I did it, I learned a whole lot.  
<br>
<br>
For the next few weeks, I plan on reading through many papers recommended to me by my advisor. We are in the beginnings of writing a paper, so I am expecting to learn a lot and get a lot more ideas for plots to make!
