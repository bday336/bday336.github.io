This week started off with a very informative talk by visitng speaker, <a href="http://www-utap.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hartwig/index.html"><font color="#0000ff">Tilman Hartwig</font></a> (Hello to you, if you are reading this!). Afterwards, we had a great discussion about our research, and he gave me some good ideas of scientific paths to go down. One of which I investigated right away. So far I have only been considering the Lyman Werner background produced by stars that are external to the host halo I am looking at. But when I allowed the older stars in the halo to radiate (stars that are older that the Pop3 star I am focused on), I found that two distinct groups of halos form in the JLW/J21 vs. Halo mass space. One group is well below the Machacek+ 2001 mass threshold line and with large Lyman Werner flux, and the other above the mass threshold line and with low flux. I believe this is indicative of which halos form many stars (the former group) and which halos form one or only a few stars (the latter group). This is something I will be investigating further!

I also changed my interactive plot I talked about in my last post to bring up a montage of images related to the point I clicked on. This is super useful and something I will be using a lot more in the future.

Most of the rest of my week was focused on trying to find a bug in my code. I am having problems plotting some outlier star particles for reasons that are not obvious to me yet. This is something I would love to get figured out ASAP!
