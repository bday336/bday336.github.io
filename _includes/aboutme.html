        About Me
    </h1>

    Hello! I am Brian and welcome to my website. I am PhD candidate working the <a href="https://matsumoto.gatech.edu/"><font color="#0000ff">Geometry of Materials Group</font></a> headed by Dr. Elisabetta Matsumoto at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am research resides near the connection between geometry and dynamics and how they can effect each other in non-intuitive ways. This is largely formalized within the field of Geometric Mechanics, however I am interested in expanding our understanding of how deformable systems can interact with their environment through controlling the shape of their bodies.

    Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor of Science from the University of Washington with a double major in physics and astronomy and a double minor in mathematics and philosophy. While at UW, I was a student assistant in the Telescope Engineering Lab, which worked primarily for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    While I am not analyzing cosmological simulations, I get to spend time at home with my two kitties, Hobbes and Leto. I also enjoy my fair share of playing video games and knitting. I am currently learning how to handstand and practice contortion!
