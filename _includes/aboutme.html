    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hello! My name is Danielle Ruth Skinner and I'm a graduate research assistant in the <a href="http://cosmo.gatech.edu/">Computational Cosmology Group</a> led by Dr. John Wise at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am interested in galaxy evolution and formation, the first stars in the universe, and matching observations with cosmological simulations. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor of Science from the University of Washington with a double major in physics and astronomy and a double minor in mathematics and philosophy. While at UW, I was a student assistant in the Telescope Engineering Lab, which worked primarily for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    While I am not analyzing cosmological simulations, I get to spend time at home with my two kitties, Hobbes and Leto. I also enjoy my fair share of playing video games and knitting.
