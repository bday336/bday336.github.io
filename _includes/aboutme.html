    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hello! My name is Danielle Ruth Skinner and I'm a graduate research assistant in the <a href="http://cosmo.gatech.edu/"><font color="#0000ff">Computational Cosmology Group</font></a> led by Dr. John Wise at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am interested in galaxy evolution and formation, the first stars in the universe, and matching observations with cosmological simulations. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my Bachelor of Science from the University of Washington with a double major in physics and astronomy and a double minor in mathematics and philosophy. While at UW, I was a student assistant in the Telescope Engineering Lab, which worked primarily for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    While I am not analyzing cosmological simulations, I get to spend time at home with my two kitties, Hobbes and Leto. I also enjoy my fair share of playing video games and knitting.

    Here are some cool images from one of my favorite memories. I had the opportunity to help re-aluminize the 3.5 meter Apache Point Observatory mirror. I am in the middle of the mirror, carefully trying not to touch the surface.

    Here we are putting the freshly aluminized mirror back into the massive box. This took serious care to make sure the surface wasn't touched by <b>anything</b>.
