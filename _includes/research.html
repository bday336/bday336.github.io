  <h1>Current Research Projects</h1>
  	For my first research project at Georgia Tech, I am working on analyzing the environments of the first stars in the universe. Using a 1 Mepaparsec comoving volume simulation, I am able to analyze when, where, and in what type of halos population 3 stars form in. More details on this soon!

 	 For now, here are some images to satisfy your curiosity. The first image is a projected density from the end of the simulation at a redshift of 9.9. The second image is from the beginning of the simulation at a redshift of 27.2. You can see that at higher redshifts, when the universe was much younger, the typical filaments and voids that we see today at redshift zero, and at redshift 9, don't exist yet. After about 13 million years from a redshift of 27.2 are filaments and voids fully visible, at a redshift of 9. In those millions of years, things are happening! Galaxies are merging, stars are born and die, and the universe is expanding. Simulations like this provide fascinating insight into what the universe looked like long, long, long ago.

  <h1>Past Research Projects</h1>
  While at the University of Washington, I was investigating dust attenuation at high redshifts. Using the <a href="https://mtremmel.github.io/research/romulus.html"><font color="#0000ff">Romulus simulations</font></a> and a post-processing radiative transfer code called <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/root/index.html"><font color="#0000ff">SKIRT</font></a>, I was able to simulate radiative transfer in galaxies to look at the IRX-&beta relationship. This relationship is used to infer star-formation at high redshifts, yet the relationship is calibrated to local galaxies. I was investigating whether or not this was a good assumption to make, and if not, what would a better fit be for high redshift galaxies.

  SKIRT is a great tool for generating beautiful images of galaxies. There are a few examples below, of galaxies at a redshift of 0, plotted in RGB color.
