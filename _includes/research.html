  <h1>Current Research Projects</h1>
  I am currently investigating nucleosynthesis from neutron star mergers (NSM) in the very early universe. A major job of astrophysicists is to figure out where all the elements in the universe came from. While we know where a lot of elements come from, the source of the heaviest elements is still a bit of a mystery. The source of r-process elements, elements produced via the rapid process where neutrons are bombarded onto an atom to build up heavier metals, is what I will be focused on. In NSMs, a ton of r-process elements are produced, as seen by the gravitational wave detected by LIGO, GW170817. This could be a major source of r-process elements, but has not been investigated via cosmological simulations.

  My current project is to model a NSM, which resulted form the supernova of two Pop III stars, within an ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, to see how the NSM model parameters correlate with r-process abundances. We will be using Reticulum 2 as a case study, since that UFD galaxy contains r-process enhanced stars. This work has been funded by the Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology award beginning in August of 2020.

  <h1>Past Research Projects</h1>
  <h3>Georgia Tech</h3>
  In January of 2020, I published my first paper, titled <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/3/4386/5707420"><font color="#0000ff"></font>"Cradles of the first stars: self-shielding, halo masses, and multiplicity"</font></a> in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. This paper focused on the birthplaces of the first stars, where we tried to uncover what types of halos form Population III stars in the presence of a Lyman-Werner (LW) background using cosmological simulations run with Enzo. We found that halos can form Pop III stars at lower masses compared to previous work, thanks to H2 self-shielding. We also found that halos are more likely to form multiple Pop III stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of Pop III star formation. We find no correlation between average LW background and host halo mass at the instance of star formation, implying that LW radiation feedback may not affect Pop III star formation as much as previously thought. This can be seen in the figure below.

  Here we have the average LW radiation within a host halo plotted against the host halo mass for every Pop III star that forms in the simulation, colored by the redshift of formation. The black line shows the minimum mass threshold from Machacek et al. (2001). We see most of our halos form Pop III stars below the minimum mass threshold, thanks to H2 self-shielding. There are a few halos that can form multiple Pop III stars in the presence of a high LW background, although this only occurs when there are neighboring halos forming stars at about the same time. When this happens, the LW radiation coming from one neighbor halo doesn't have enough time to dissociate H2 in the second neighbor halo. 

  <h3>University of Washington</h3>
  While at the University of Washington, I was investigating dust attenuation at high redshifts. Using the <a href="https://mtremmel.github.io/research/romulus.html"><font color="#0000ff">Romulus simulations</font></a> and a post-processing radiative transfer code called <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/root/index.html"><font color="#0000ff">SKIRT</font></a>, I was able to simulate radiative transfer in galaxies to look at the IRX-&beta relationship. This relationship is used to infer star-formation at high redshifts, yet the relationship is calibrated to local galaxies. I was investigating whether or not this was a good assumption to make, and if not, what would a better fit be for high redshift galaxies.

  SKIRT is a great tool for generating beautiful images of galaxies. There are a few examples below, of galaxies at a redshift of 0, plotted in RGB color.
