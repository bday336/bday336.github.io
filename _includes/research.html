  <h1>Current Research Projects</h1>
  
  My research has revolved around investigating the oddities that arise when solving dynamics in spaces with instrinsic curvature. The presence of curvature results in geometric effects that challenge our everday intuition of how things move and interact. While these spaces are largely mathematical in nature, I feel that studying how systems evolution in such spaces can lead to a deeper insight of dynamics in flat space or at the very least allow one to think about dynamics from a different perspective in general.
  <br> 
  <br>
  Through computer simulations, my collaborator and I have been working on developing a physics engine designed to solve dynamics in arbitrary curved spaces. This is in pursuit of being able to better visualize and model deformable systems with internal controls in curved space. These systems can span from simple swimmers on the surface of a sphere or sword fighting octopuses in hyperbolic space. I am not only intereseted in the computational aspect of setting up and running the simulations, but also theoretically deriving the dynamical equations mathematical.

  <h1>Past Research Projects</h1>
  <h3>Georgia Tech</h3>
  During the beginning of my PhD work, my first project was developing educational VR simulations. We wanted to create a more immersive experience for students to be able to gain better understanding and intuition of 3D vector fields which are common undergraduate math and physics courses. Particularly, fields that describe dynamical systems or processes, like those are differential equations or electrodynamics, can be difficult to parse given a 2D visualize on a page. With this in mind, I designed a VR environment where the user to observe and interact with both static as well as dynamical 3D vector fields. Originally built in JavaScript to be webhosted, the program was transferred to Unity with help from my undergradate research assistant Othman Alrawri. Our work on this project has been published under <a href="https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2022/bridges2022-367.html#gsc.tab=0"><font color="#0000ff"></font>"Visualizing Virtual Vector Fields"</font></a> and was presented on at the 2022 Bridges Conference.

<!--   Here we have the average LW radiation within a host halo plotted against the host halo mass for every Pop III star that forms in the simulation, colored by the redshift of formation. The black line shows the minimum mass threshold from Machacek et al. (2001). We see most of our halos form Pop III stars below the minimum mass threshold, thanks to H2 self-shielding. There are a few halos that can form multiple Pop III stars in the presence of a high LW background, although this only occurs when there are neighboring halos forming stars at about the same time. When this happens, the LW radiation coming from one neighbor halo doesn't have enough time to dissociate H2 in the second neighbor halo.  -->

<!--   <h3>University of Washington</h3>
  While at the University of Washington, I was investigating dust attenuation at high redshifts. Using the <a href="https://mtremmel.github.io/research/romulus.html"><font color="#0000ff">Romulus simulations</font></a> and a post-processing radiative transfer code called <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/root/index.html"><font color="#0000ff">SKIRT</font></a>, I was able to simulate radiative transfer in galaxies to look at the IRX-&beta relationship. This relationship is used to infer star-formation at high redshifts, yet the relationship is calibrated to local galaxies. I was investigating whether or not this was a good assumption to make, and if not, what would a better fit be for high redshift galaxies.

  SKIRT is a great tool for generating beautiful images of galaxies. There are a few examples below, of galaxies at a redshift of 0, plotted in RGB color.
