  	For my first research project at Georgia Tech, I am working on analyzing the environments of the first stars in the universe. Using a 1 Mepaparsec comoving volume simulation, I am able to analyze when, where, and in what type of halos population 3 stars form in. More details on this soon!

 	 For now, here are some images to satisfy your curiosity. The first image is a projected density from the end of the simulation at a redshift of 9.9. The second image is from the beginning of the simulation at a redshift of 27.2. You can see that at higher redshifts, when the universe was much younger, the typical filaments and voids that we see today at redshift zero, and at redshift 9, don't exist yet. After about 13 million years from a redshift of 27.2 are filaments and voids fully visible, at a redshift of 9. In those millions of years, things are happening! Galaxies are merging, stars are born and die, and the universe is expanding. Simulations like this provide fascinating insight into what the universe looked like long, long, long ago.
